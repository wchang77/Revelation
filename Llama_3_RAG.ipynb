            "\n",
            "  * **Potatoes:** Use your choice of potatoes for this recipe. Some home cooks use starchy russet potatoes and others prefer all-purpose Yukon Gold potatoes – either kind works well but there are differences in the outcome. Russet potatoes will add their starchiness to the dish as they cook, helping the sauce thicken. Yukon Gold potatoes aren't as starchy, and will hold their shape better as they cook.\n",
            "  * **Onion:** Choose a medium sized yellow or white onion to add savory flavor to the scalloped potatoes.\n",
            "  * **Flour:** All-purpose flour helps thicken the sauce as the scalloped potatoes bake. You'll sprinkle flour over each layer of potatoes so the sauce thickens evenly.\n",
            "  * **Butter:** A generous amount of butter distributed on each layer of potatoes adds richness.\n",
            "  * **Seasonings:** Salt and pepper enhance the flavor of the dish. Be sure to season each layer as you build up the casserole.\n",
            "  * **Milk:** This recipe recommends using whole milk, but you can also use half-and-half or cream for a richer flavor and texture. Whichever you choose to use, be sure to warm the liquid before pouring it over the potatoes, otherwise the scalloped potatoes will take longer to bake. The recipe calls for three cups, \"or as needed.\" Translation: Pour in as much warm milk as you need to come up just even with the final layer of potatoes. That milk will develop a caramelized brown crust as the scalloped potatoes bake in the oven. Some home cooks like to sprinkle an optional layer of breadcrumbs or grated cheese over the top as well to enhance the golden brown crust.\n",

            "## The Ingredients\n",
            "\n",
            "Here’s what you’ll need to make this recipe:\n",
            "\n",
            "  * **Potatoes** – choose potatoes that have a creamy texture and buttery taste. I recommend Yukon Golds.\n",
            "  * **Vegetable stock**  – instead of cooking the potatoes in just water, cook them in vegetable broth for more flavor!\n",
            "\n",
            "## The Directions\n",
            "\n",
            "  * Start by washing the potatoes, you don’t need to peel them but you can if you want to. Then using a Chef’s knife, or a julienne cutter, slice the potatoes into rings that are about 0.5cm thick (1/4 inch).\n",
            "  * You don’t want to slice them too thin as they will start breaking, and slicing them too thick might result in undercooked potatoes. So the thickness has to be just right!\n",
            "  * In an electric pressure cooker, add the potatoes along with the vegetable broth, cover with the lid and seal. Cook on manual – high pressure for 1 minute.\n",
            "  * The electric pressure cooker will take around 5-10 minutes to cook to pressure, this depends on the model that you’re using.\n",
            "  * Once the cooking is finished, quickly release the steam, take the potatoes out and arrange them in a lightly greased deep baking dish. If some of the slices start breaking, that’s okay just try to arrange them in the dish carefully.\n",
            "  * To make the cheesy sauce, start by grating the cheddar cheese. \n",
            "  * To make the sauce, melt the butter in the electric pressure cooker on the saute setting for 5 minutes. Add the garlic, and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Followed by the chopped thyme, cream, and cheddar cheese. Stir the sauce until the cheese melts completely and the sauce is smooth.\n",
            "  * Pour the sauce over the arrange potatoes in the deep baking dish, then broil for 5 minutes or until the top is bubbly and slightly browned.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Expert Tips\n",
            "\n",
            "  * Many recipes use raw sliced potatoes that are baked in the oven for over an hour. That process takes ages, so I prefer to cook raw sliced potatoes in my Instant Pot until soft, and then bake them in the oven with the cheddar sauce. This ensures that the potatoes are creamy and soft and cooked really quickly.\n",
            "  * Use high-quality sharp cheddar cheese to make a great tasting sauce, and make sure to cover the top with more grated cheddar. The cheese will melt and slightly crisp at the top which gives the dish a lovely taste and color.\n",
            "  * You don’t need to peel the potatoes for this recipe.\n",
